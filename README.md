# The Goal 

The main goals of this project are:

using a state inside components
passing down props to child components
manage a state from a main component that trickles down to child components

# The Fancy Buttons

For this project, we will create four buttons. Each button will have a specific behavior:

The counter button will keep track how many times we click on it.
The angry button will change colour to get more red until it reaches a maximum threshold.
The light switch button will turn on and off when clicked.
The text repeater button will copy the text of the button over and over.
